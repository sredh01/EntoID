# **EntoID**

EntoID is a mobile application currently in development with the goal of identifying insects using image recognition technology. This app is designed to help users learn about various insect species by uploading photos or using a live camera feed.

## **Features (Current and Planned)**

### **1. Implemented Features:**
- **Splash Screen**: A simple introduction to the app upon launch.
- **Main Tab View**:
  - **Home Tab**: Placeholder for a home screen that may include insect recommendations or app information.
  - **Search Tab**: A search functionality to allow users to find information about insects (implementation in progress).
  - **Camera Tab**: Future plans include enabling access to the device's camera for live insect detection.
  - **Notifications Tab**: Placeholder for future notifications functionality.
  - **Profile Tab**: A user profile where users can:
    - View and edit their bio.
    - Add or change their profile picture.
    - Save and bookmark insects (like a favorites list).

### **2. Planned Features:**
- **Image Recognition**:
  - Detect and identify insects via an uploaded image or live camera feed.
- **Community Features** (optional):
  - Follow other users and view their liked or bookmarked insects.
- **Profile Enhancements**:
  - Add a "like" feature for insects, allowing users to save favorites for future reference.
- **Search Enhancements**:
  - Enable robust search capabilities for discovering insects by name, category, or appearance.
- **Notifications**:
  - Notifications for app updates, profile activity, or community interactions.

## **Design and Development Goals**
- **Designs**: 
  - Currently no finalized designs for the app's tabs or pages.
  - Profile page will likely feature options for editing bio, changing profile pictures, and managing bookmarks.
- **Development Goals**:
  - Focus on implementing functional camera access and insect detection in the **Camera Tab**.
  - Improve UI/UX for a seamless user experience across tabs.

## **Future Vision**
While still in the ideation phase, EntoID may evolve into a community-driven platform where users can:
- Share insect discoveries.
- Connect with like-minded individuals passionate about entomology.
- Build a social network around insect identification and appreciation.

If the community-driven concept doesn't align with development goals, EntoID will remain focused on its primary function: identifying insects and educating users about them.
Additionally the most important feature of this project is it being a personal project. There is no plans for publishing. This is purely for educational purposes to further my understanding of swift utilizing the Xcode application.
